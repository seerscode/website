    I'm a software engineer researching <span class="font-medium text-black">mechanistic interpretability</span>.

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
    My work focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks to understand the algorithms they implement internally. I believe that understanding how models work is a crucial step towards building safe, reliable, and aligned AI systems.
