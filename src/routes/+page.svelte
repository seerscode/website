    Hello, I'm Marcio Diaz.
  </h1>
  <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
    I'm a <span class="font-medium text-black">Non Dualistic teacher</span> based in the ancient wisdom tradition of <span class="font-medium text-black">Advaita Vedanta</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
    My work is dedicated to guiding others toward the direct recognition of their true nature—the understanding that the apparent separation between the individual self and the absolute is an illusion. Through direct inquiry, self-investigation, and the timeless teachings of this tradition, I help students see through the veil of identification with the body, mind, and personal story.
