  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a software engineer transitioning into AI safety research, with a specific focus on <strong>mechanistic interpretability</strong> (MechInterp). My background in building large-scale software systems informs my approach to decomposing and understanding complex AI models.
  </p>
  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>
    My primary interest lies in identifying and understanding the 'circuits' within transformer models responsible for specific behaviors. I am particularly interested in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Induction heads and the mechanisms of in-context learning.</li>
    <li>Techniques for automated circuit discovery and verification.</li>
    <li>Superposition and the challenges of polysemantic neurons.</li>
  </ul>
