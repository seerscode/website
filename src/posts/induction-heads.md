# Introduction

One of the most fascinating discoveries in mechanistic interpretability is the existence of "induction heads." These are specific attention heads within transformer models that seem to be responsible for a significant portion of their in-context learning abilities.

## What are Induction Heads?

Induction heads work by searching for previous occurrences of the current token in the context and then attending to the token that immediately followed that previous occurrence. This allows the model to learn patterns like (A B ... A -> B) very efficiently.

## Why are they important?

Understanding induction heads is crucial because they represent a concrete, interpretable algorithm that the model has learned. This provides evidence that transformers are not just black boxes, but rather complex systems that can be decomposed into understandable parts.

```javascript
// A simplified example of the attention pattern
function inductionHeadAttention(Q, K, V) {
  // ... implementation details
  console.log("Attention is the key!");
}
```

## Future Research

There is still much to learn about how these heads form and how they interact with other mechanisms within the model.
