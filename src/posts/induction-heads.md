# Introduction

One of the most fascinating discoveries in mechanistic interpretability is the existence of "induction heads." These are specific attention heads within transformer models that seem to be responsible for a significant portion of their in-context learning abilities.


## How Inductive Heads Work

To understand inductive heads, you first need a basic grasp of the **attention mechanism** in a transformer, the architecture behind most LLMs. The attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input text when producing the next word. It lets every token "look" at every other previous token and decide which ones are most relevant.

An inductive head is a specific, highly structured pattern of attention involving a partnership between at least **two separate attention heads** working together across different layers of the model. Let's call them the "previous token head" and the "induction head."

1.  **The 'Previous Token' Head**: This attention head is simple. Its job is to look at the token that comes *immediately before* the current token being processed.
2.  **The 'Induction' Head**: This head is the star of the show. It takes the information from the 'previous token' head and searches backward through the entire sequence to find a *prior occurrence* of that same token. Once it finds it, the induction head directs the model to pay strong attention to the token that came *after* that prior occurrence.

This two-step process allows the model to complete a sequence by copying. By finding a previous instance of the pattern's prefix, it can predict what comes next.



### An Example in Action

Let's trace how an inductive head would help a model complete a simple, repetitive sequence. Imagine the model is given the following prompt and must predict the next token:

`A B C A B` __?__

The model's goal is to predict `C`. Here’s how the inductive heads make it happen:

1.  **Current Position**: The model is focused on the position right after the second `B`, trying to decide what comes next.
2.  **'Previous Token' Head**: An attention head at this final position looks at the immediately preceding token, which is `B`.
3.  **'Induction' Head**: The induction head takes note of this `B`. It then scans backwards through the text to find the *first* time `B` appeared. It finds it in the initial `A B C` sequence.
4.  **Copying the Pattern**: The induction head then directs the model's attention to the token that followed that *first* `B`. That token is `C`.
5.  **Prediction**: Because the model is now strongly attending to `C`, it assigns a very high probability to `C` being the next token in the sequence. It has successfully identified the `A B C` pattern and continued it.

This same mechanism is at work in more complex tasks. When you give a model few-shot examples like `translate apple -> manzana, translate car -> coche, translate house ->` __?__, inductive heads help identify the "translate X -> Y" pattern, find the prefix "translate house ->", and copy the pattern of providing a Spanish word.

## The Significance of Inductive Heads

The discovery of inductive heads was a major breakthrough in **mechanistic interpretability**—the field dedicated to reverse-engineering how neural networks work. Their importance cannot be overstated for several reasons:

* **In-Context Learning**: Inductive heads are considered a primary mechanism for in-context learning. They enable LLMs to perform tasks demonstrated in the prompt without being explicitly fine-tuned for them. This ability to "learn on the fly" is what makes LLMs so versatile.
* **Meta-Learning**: On a deeper level, inductive heads contribute to a model's ability to perform meta-learning, or "learning to learn." By identifying and executing algorithms present in the prompt (like "complete the sequence" or "translate the word"), the model isn't just recalling facts; it's learning and applying a procedure from the context.
* **Algorithmic Behavior**: The simple copy-paste algorithm performed by an inductive head is a foundational building block. More complex behaviors and reasoning can be constructed from simple, emergent circuits like these.

The fact that these sophisticated circuits arise spontaneously from the simple goal of predicting the next word in a massive text dataset is a powerful testament to the principles of deep learning. They are a perfect example of how complex, intelligent behavior can emerge from simple, optimized processes.
